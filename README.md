# Learning DOD using my old assignments

I know this sound a bit weird why I am still touching some of my old assignments where people don't want to see than after all the pain and sorrow when they were working on it, but I choose this assignment for some good reasons.

This assignment has a precise requirement which give me a clear direction of building something meaningful, without ending up with an aimless direction out with no concern about any confidential data. While this assignment were written in an OOP manner, so that I can study how to convert the objects into rational table which is the fundamental of Data Oriented Design. I also know that this assignment were fulfill most of the OOP concepts such that I can have some materials to evaluate between two programming concept.

I am no longer a student in that school of that assignment, but after a bit of recovery, it is the time going back to learning to something I really need for my future goals.
